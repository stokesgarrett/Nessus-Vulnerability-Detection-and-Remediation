# Nessus Vulnerability Detection and Remediation

## Objective

The Nessus Vulnerability Detection and Remediation project focused on performing non-credentialed and credentialed scans on both a Windows 10 host and a Windows XP host, with and without a deprecated Firefox browser installed. 
The results of each scenario are compared an contrasted between the non-credentialed scan and the credentialed scan.
This project enhanced understanding of vulnerability detection and remediation of network hosts.

### Skills Learned

- Skilled in utilizing Nessus for thorough vulnerability assessments on diverse operating systems, including Windows 10 and Windows XP.
- Demonstrated ability to compare and contrast non-credentialed versus credentialed scan results, enhancing detection accuracy.
- Adept at configuring and running scans, focusing on effective remediation strategies to address identified vulnerabilities.
- Enhanced analytical and critical thinking skills through the interpretation of scan data and implementation of remediation measures to secure network hosts.

### Tools Used

- Vulnerability Scanning: Employed Nessus to perform both non-credentialed and credentialed scans on Windows 10 and Windows XP hosts.
- Operating System Configuration: Utilized Windows 10 and Windows XP environments, including setups with and without a deprecated Firefox browser, to analyze vulnerability differences.
- Learning Resources: Referenced Nessus documentation and online resources to master scan configurations and interpret results effectively.
